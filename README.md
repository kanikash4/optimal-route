# Optimal-Route-Identification

 Intent: Find the most optimal route given two points. The optimal route should be based on time but not on distance (length)

> Design and implement a web service to perform following functions: 

  1. Create a new route:
      ````sh
      a. Define the input structure of your own choice.
      b. Validate the input if it meets all the input requirements.
      ````
  2. Update the existing grid/route
      ````sh
      a. Define the input structure of your choice
      b. Validate the input if it meets all the input requirements
      ````
  3. Get the grid/route
      ````sh
      a. Return the grid/route in any readable representation of your choice
      ````
  4. Given two points start and end, give the optimal route and the points visited on the way in correct order
      ````sh
      a. Input: list of two points
      b. Output: List of the points in sequence that needs to be visited for the optimal route
      ````
